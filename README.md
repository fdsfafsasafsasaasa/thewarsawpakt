## Hello there!

### My name is Tommy.

My expertise is over designing applications to be incredibly modular.

The topics that I am familiar in are:

    - Python
    - A little java
    - A little javascript
    - A little c++ (don't ask me to write in it)
    - Mongodb
    - SQlite
    - Linux

My current setup is:
    1. Lenovo IdeaPad S340-15IWL 
        - Runs Arch Linux
        - i3-gaps
        - 5.10 tkg kernel
    2. Gaming desktop
        - Runs Arch Linux
        - Gnome 3 (fight me)
        - Zen kernel
